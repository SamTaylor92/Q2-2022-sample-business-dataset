An exploratory data analysis of a dataset. <br><br>

The same analysis was conducted in both `Pandas` and `Google Sheets` and the resulting visualisations were added to a `Google Slides` deck.

<summary> <h2> [Brief] </h2> </summary>
You're an Analyst for a new company called MaraÃ±Ã³n (similar to Amazon), and you've been asked to prepare a presentation for both Sales & Operations that summarizes sales and operations thus far. The summary should include (and the very least) an overview of the company's current state, current customer satisfaction, and proposal for 2-3 areas where the company can improve.<br><br>

__Here are some additional facts:__

- Pretend it is currently Sep-18, so you can ignore all data after this date.
- The company was founded in Jan-17, so you can ignore all data prior to this.
- The company is based in the USA, but it was founded in Brazil.
- You can presume that all orders have been delivered - so ignore the order state field.
- All available data can be downloaded from this link: 
    - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16JuqYZIfYKyWCkahQtX9lWtSVji820th?usp=sharing

__Your presentation should:__
- Include no more than 10 slides
- Last no longer than 20 minutes<br>

__Tip:__ Create a structure for answering the questions. If you're not sure what questions to ask, make some up for yourself. It dramatically simplifies the task of digging for data.

<summary> <h2> [Questions to answer] </h2> </summary> 

To make the analysis more focused, I focused on the following questions:

- Where are the company's customers located?
- How are the company's sales?
- Which products sell best?
- What is the relationship between units sold and delivery cost?
- What percentage of a product's expenses is transportation costs?
- How satisfied are customers?
- Why is there a dip in customer satisfaction (CSAT) in Q4 2017 & Q1 2018?
- What other factors contribute to the negative CSAT?

The following was done with the data, so that it was ready to be analysed:
- Joined datasets together
- Renamed columns
- Removed white space
- Changed data types to more appropriate ones
- Dropped columns that were not relevant
- Removed specific rows with several NaN values
- Removed any data that didn't fall between 2017 and 2018

After cleaning the data, I:
- Combined columns to create relevant metrics/key performance indicators relevant to the dataset:
  - `quarter` from the __[order_purchase_timestamp]__
  - `month` from the __[order_purchase_timestamp]__
  - `percent of NR`: __[payment_value]__ / __[payment_value]__.sum() *100
  - `CSAT`: [__review_score__ > 3, True(100), False(0)]
  - `days_until_delivered`: __[order_delivered_customer_date]__ - __[order_purchase_timestamp]__
  - `actual_delivery_date_minus_estimated_delivery_date`: __[order_delivered_customer_date]__ - __[order_estimated_delivery_date]__
  - `delivery SLA`:  np.where(`actual_delivery_date_minus_estimated_delivery_date` >0, 0,1)
- Correlated data to look for interesting patterns in the data
- Statistically analysed significance of relationships
- Split data into relevant slices, to begin to analyse the questions outlined above
- Visualised the data
